# Game-Consoles-Analysis
The purpose of this report is to carry out an analysis to identify patterns that determine whether a game will succeed or not and spot potential big winners and help plan advertising campaigns.  In the report hereinafter, I will study the data provided by Ice, an online store, which sells video games all over the world, User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) and historical data on game sales that is available from open sources. The data in the data frame goes back to 2016.  To complete the analysis I will fix problematic values in the data, fill in missing values, add columns to the data set and remove duplicated rows, as required. Once the data frame is preprocessed and clean, I will calculate each platform's total sales generated each year. Then, I will consider whether to examine if there are outliers in the data frame, remove them as I deem necessary, and add a column containing each platform's decade of active sales. Then, I will draw conclusions in regards to platforms' average life, peak sales and average user ratings of specific platforms and specific genres.
